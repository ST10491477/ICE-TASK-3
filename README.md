ICE TASK 3 – Simple guess the Number game 

Guess the Number is a simple and interactive Android game developed using Kotlin and the traditional Views system in Android Studio. The objective of the game is for the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the app provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct. Once the correct number is guessed, the game resets automatically, allowing the player to continue playing. This game demonstrates fundamental concepts of Android app development such as user input handling, event-driven programming, and basic logic implementation in Kotlin.
